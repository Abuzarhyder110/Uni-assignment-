Q:4
 Restaurant bill calculator

Get user input
num_people = int(input("Enter the number of people: "))
cost_per_meal = float(input("Enter the cost of each meal: $"))
sales_tax_percentage = float(input("Enter the sales tax percentage: "))
tip_percentage = float(input("Enter the tip percentage: "))

Calculate totals
total_cost_of_food = num_people * cost_per_meal
total_sales_tax = total_cost_of_food * (sales_tax_percentage / 100)
total_tip_amount = total_cost_of_food * (tip_percentage / 100)
total_bill_amount = total_cost_of_food + total_sales_tax + total_tip_amount
bill_amount_per_person = total_bill_amount / num_people

Print results
print(f"\nTotal cost of food: ${total_cost_of_food:.2f}")
print(f"Total sales tax: ${total_sales_tax:.2f}")
print(f"Total tip amount: ${total_tip_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Total bill amount per person: ${bill_amount_per_person:.2f}")
