#Exercise 1:
Write a program using a for loop to print the number 1 to 10
for i in range (1,11) : 
     print (i)
#Exercise 2 : 
Create a program that uses a for loop to print the multiplication table of user - inputted number
# Get user input
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Print multiplication table up to 10
for i in range(1, 11):
    result = num * i
    print(f"{num} x {i} = {result}")

#Exercise 3:
Write a program using a while loop to find the sum of natural number upto a given number entered by a username
while i←=num 
sum += i
i += i
print ("the sum of natural number upto given number entered by username")

#Exercise 4:
Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate through a list of name and prints each name
names = ['abuzar' , 'hyder' , 'muzamil' , 'izhar']
for names in name
print (name)

#Exeecise 5 : 
Write a program using a while loop to find the factorial of a user inputted number
num = int(input("Enter a number:"))
factorial = 1
i = 1 
while i= num :
factorial *=1
i += 1

#Exercise 6 :
Create a program using a for loop to print the Fibbaconi series upto a specified number of terms entered by the user.
Get the number of terms from the user
num_terms = int(input("Enter the number of terms for the Fibonacci series: "))

# Initialize the first two terms
a, b = 0, 1

# Print the Fibonacci series
for _ in range(num_terms):
    print(a, end=" ")
    a, b = b, a + b

#Exercise 7: 
Write a program using a while loop to reverse a number entered by the user.
# Get input from the user
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialize variables
reversed_number = 0

# Reverse the number using a while loop
while number > 0:
    digit = number % 10  # Get the last digit
    reversed_number = (reversed_number * 10) + digit  # Append the digit to the reversed number
    number = number // 10  # Remove the last digit from the original number

# Display the reversed number
print("Reversed number:", reversed_number)

#Exercise 8 : 
Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate through a string and count the number of vovels
def count_vowels(input_string):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0

    for char in input_string:
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1

    return count

# Example usage:
input_string = "Hello, World!"
result = count_vowels(input_string)
print(f'The number of vowels in "{input_string}" is {result}.')

#Exercise 9:
Write a program using a while loop to check if user inputted number is a palindrome
def is_palindrome(num):
    original_num = num
    reversed_num = 0

    while num > 0:
        digit = num % 10
        reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
        num = num // 10

    return original_num == reversed_num

user_input = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_palindrome(user_input):
    print(f"{user_input} is a palindrome.")
else:
    print(f"{user_input} is not a palindrome.")

#Exercise 10:
Create a program using a for loop to calculate and print the sum of squares of the number from 1 to 5
sum_of_squares = 0

for num in range(1, 6):
    sum_of_squares += num ** 2

print("Sum of the squares:", sum_of_squares)When you run this program, it will output:Sum of the squares: 55
